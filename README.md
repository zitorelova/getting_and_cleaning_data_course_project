Final Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course offered by John Hopkins University through Coursera

This is the final project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course offered by John Hopkins University through Coursera.
The R script run_analysis.R preprocesses the data found in this URL: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
The resulting data set called tidy_data.txt groups the data between each activity and subject number while taking an average of each of the variables. 
Also included is a Codebook explaining the variables and the process used to clean the data.
